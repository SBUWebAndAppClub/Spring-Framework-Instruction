      <p>  Hi all,
        As agreed, we will be making our first project using java's Spring framework. Spring is a way to somewhat avoid the strenuous xml-mappings of certain websites. You can do many things in Spring just by creating Java Objects. If you don't know how to create Java objects, I can teach you in one day.

        I am still learning the framework myself, but managed to scrape together a website.

        In order to avoid any confusion, I will make a video creating the website from scratch, discussing injection dependency with Maven, (fancy word for using other code to make your life easier), the way spring maps url-s to HTML and CSS pages, and how easy it is to create your own localhost static page.

        This video will most likely be uploaded tomorrow, and I can promise it will make your life so much easier. Follow along, and you will create the same project I did.

        The benefit of having this club versus learning on your own is that you have a network of other people you can ask for advice. As soon as you have some sort of error, you can email me and i can TRY MY BEST to help you. Remember, I just learned this in the past 2 days.

        I uploaded this code to our github. Download it. Try to run it. Let me know how it goes! nostrum numquam enim autem quisquam, odit recusandae? Voluptate quibusdam pariatur veritatis necessitatibus beatae eius ex.</p>
